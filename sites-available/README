REDIRECTS

Example menhardt.com:
1) we want all http requests to go to https
2) we want menhardt.com requests to go to www.menhardt.com; the reason is that menhardt wiki (a) uses
   the host name to filter the database (table pages, column site = "www.menhardt.com", so "menhardt.com"
   is actually a different site); this can be overriden with table site_maps, but (b) menhard with
   caches requests in a directory cache/www.menhardt.com, and requests to menhardt.com would not hit that
   cache

Nginx rules
  http://menhardt.com -> https://www.menhardt.com (in redirect.conf)
  http://www.menhardt.com -> https://www.menhardt.com (in redirect.conf)
  https://menhardt.com -> https://www.menhardt.com (first rule in menhardt.conf)
  https://www.menhardt.com -> forward request to cache (first) or rails (second rule rule in menhardt.conf)
 

NGINX CONFIGURATION

sudo nginx -t
- checks the configuration files
sudo nginx restart
- installs the new configuration


/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  generic, includes conf.d/*, sites-enabled/*, and deny.conf
/etc/nginx/deny.conf
  lists "bad" IP addresses
/etc/nginx/conf.d
  redirect.conf
  - redirects http:// protocol to https:// protocol for all sites
  - could be done using wild card, but doing it explicitly is easer to debug
/etc/sites-available
  default.conf
  - shows /var/rails/html/index.html (check browser console)
  menhardt.conf
  - for all *menhardt* urls
  - redirects https://example...  to https://xxx.example...
  - then handles https://xxx.example
  max.conf
  - all of max's sites


CERTBOT
Certificates are from Certbot, and installed as described in:
https://certbot.eff.org/lets-encrypt/ubuntuxenial-nginx
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx

To create and install a certificate do this:
  sudo certbot --nginx certonly --cert-name www.menhardt.com
  ...and it will ask you which sites you want included... it takes the
  list from the existing nginx configuration, so need to make sure the
  site is listed - for example in redirect.conf

Certificates are all listed in:
  sudo ls /etc/letsencrypt/live
  sudo certbot certificates --cert-name www.menhardt.com  
  sudo certbot certificates

Remove
  sudo certbot revoke --cert-path /etc/letsencrypt/live/CERTNAME/cert.pem

Certificates need to be renewed every 4-5 months
  sudo certbot renew --dry-run

There needs to be a cronjob for renewal - should run every month; the renewal
only happens when expiry is within the next 30 days
45 03 15 * * certbot renew --pre-hook "service nginx stop" --post-hook "service nginx start" >> /var/log/letsencrypt/renew.log
